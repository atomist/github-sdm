## [Unreleased](https://github.com/atomist/sdm/compare/0.3.1...HEAD)

### Added

-   Add paging for goals. [#436](https://github.com/atomist/sdm/issues/436)
-   Add DSL for creating Goals. [#437](https://github.com/atomist/sdm/issues/437)
-   Add "build aware" code transform support. Replaces "dry run" support presently in `sdm-core`.
-   `CodeTransform` now takes a second argument of type `CommandListenerInvocation` for consistency and to expose more context to transforms
-   `CodeInspecton` registration to run a non-mutating command against one or more repositories
-   Add goal set completion listener. [#275](https://github.com/atomist/sdm/issues/275)
-   Support BitBucket. [#225](https://github.com/atomist/sdm/issues/225)
-   `CodeTransform` registration can now specify a `react` method to run after transforms are complete.

### Changed

-   **BREAKING** Command handler and autofix registrations are now strongly typed, defaulting to `NoParameters` rather than `any`. 
-   **BREAKING** Remove deprecated `addEditor` SDM method, and deprecated `createTransform` method on `ProjectOperationRegistration`.
-   **BREAKING** `addPushReaction` renamed `addPushImpactListener` for consistency
-   **BREAKING** `addNewRepoWithCodeAction` renamed `addNewRepoWithCodeListener` for consistency
-   **BREAKING**  `CodeTransformRegistration.editMode` is replaced by `transformPresentation`

### Fixed

-   Make a better workaround for not getting org token on custom events. [#279](https://github.com/atomist/sdm/issues/279)
-   Link is missing on npm publish goal. [#447](https://github.com/atomist/sdm/issues/447)

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/atomist/sdm/compare/0.3.0...0.3.1) - 2018-07-05

### Added

-   Timeout goals after 10mins or config value. [#427](https://github.com/atomist/sdm/issues/427)
-   Allow generator registrations to specify a starting point. [#425](https://github.com/atomist/sdm/issues/425)

### Changed

-   Rename "editor" to "codeTransform" for clarity. [#424](https://github.com/atomist/sdm/issues/424)
-   **BREAKING** `onAnyPush` becomes a function to avoid side effects.
-   **BREAKING** `CodeTransform` is now an alias for `SimpleProjectEditor` to make the commonest case natural. Use `CodeTransformRegisterable` to return an `EditResult`.
-   Generators can now have parameter types that don't extend `SeedDrivenGeneratorParameters`, as this will be mixed in.

### Deprecated

-   Rename to GoalInvocation; deprecate status. [#426](https://github.com/atomist/sdm/issues/426)

### Removed
